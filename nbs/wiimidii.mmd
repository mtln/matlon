For our concerts with [Amtsbladt](http://www.amtsbladt.ch), a Swiss electro-pop duo where I was responsible for composition and music, 
and my friend Phil handled lyrics and vocals, I wrote software to convert the movements of the guitar neck into MIDI signals. I had attached a Wiimote to the guitar head. 
With quick movements in different directions, I could trigger samples, and with slower movements, I could control parameters of the guitar effects. 
In addition, I could use the Wiimote buttons to control Ableton Live (start tracks).

Thereâ€™s nothing more boring at concerts than guys on stage sitting behind a laptop. As an audience member, you have no idea if what they're doing has anything 
to do with what you're hearing or if they're just checking their emails or stock prices. Thatâ€™s why I was behind the guitar and not behind a computer.  
For the Guitar Rig Hero Contest by Native Instruments, I demonstrated my setup in a rather silly [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSY9S_ypdI) ðŸ¤£.
