        "description": "My first software that was used productively was called 'Patient'. I wrote it as a teenager in Turbo Pascal for my mother, who, in addition to being a housewife, also worked part-time as a self-employed physiotherapist. The DOS application was multicolored and could be operated with a mouse. We had an Intel 80386 DX 20 MHz computer with a 1 GB hard drive and a simple dot-matrix printer. With my patient management software, one could not only schedule appointments and do the accounting, but also directly fill out the yellow forms that had to be submitted to the disability insurance (IV) for billing. At the time, my mother was probably the only physiotherapist who sent forms to the insurance not handwritten but neatly filled out by a printer 😀. \n\n ![Patient menu screenshot](patient1.jpg) \n\nThe completely exaggerated title 'Physikalisch-Therapeutisches Institut Ruth Krämer & Co.' was, of course, meant as a family insider joke.  \n\n ![Patient detail screenshot](patient2.jpg)"

        "description": "Music was always my great love. After high school, I went to the Jazz School in Lucerne, but later decided to pursue a degree in computer science at ETH Zurich. Ear training is essential in music, so I programmed 'Ohr', a software for ear training, which allowed users to practice recognizing intervals, chords and their inversions, scales, and so on. To make it possible to practice on the go (laptops didn't exist yet), the software included a feature for creating exercises that could be recorded directly onto cassette. In parallel, the solutions were printed out so that one could practice with a Walkman and a sheet of paper wherever they wanted. The Sound Blaster card was the first to support speech synthesis and could be used with a text-to-speech command-line tool `c:\\sb\\sbtalker\\say.exe`. So, to keep track during practice, every 10 exercises were announced.  \n\n ![Soundblaster](ohr1.jpg)"

        "description": "To access the internet back then, you had to dial in via a modem over the phone line. There was a basic charge for establishing the connection and a per-minute fee with three different time-based pricing levels. Internet costs could quickly become very high, and if you lived in a shared apartment or worked remotely for an employer, you needed to know for each 'internet session' when it happened, how long it lasted, and who would be responsible for paying at the end of the month.\n\nThat's exactly why I wrote Teltax. It was activated each time a modem connection ended, allowing you to specify whose account the costs should be charged to. The details were read from the technical log of the Win95 modem driver (e.g., `c:\\win95\\ModemLog_Zeus 336E External 33600 Fax Modem.txt`). Then, the costs were calculated based on the three different price levels and written into a log file. At the end of the billing period, a total cost per user was calculated. Additionally, the data volume was analyzed, and the cost per megabyte was calculated. Since charges were based on time rather than data volume back then, the goal was, of course, to keep the cost per megabyte as low as possible by truly using the connection and not keeping it open for too long.\n\n ![Teltax summary screenshot](teltax1.jpg)"

        "description": "Back in the mid-90s, while studying at ETH, I always carried a cassette with self-generated pink noise for my Walkman (I used Cool Edit for that). Later, of course, it was an MP3. In 2013, there was an opportunity to release an EP for free on Spotify and other streaming platforms. I used this to publish my pink noise tracks online under the name 'Brainwaver', so there's no need for copying MP3s anymore.  \n\nI listen to the tracks through headphones whenever I want to focus in a noisy environment or just unwind and relax. Pink noise masks external sounds and, unlike music, doesn’t distract. White noise has an evenly distributed intensity across the frequency spectrum (which can sound quite harsh). With pink noise, the intensity decreases as frequency increases; the lower frequencies are louder, while the higher ones are softer, creating a more pleasant sound—similar to a waterfall.\n\nThere's a theory that the binaural modulation of noise, when listened to with headphones, can cause brain waves to synchronize with the modulation frequency, potentially inducing certain mental states (e.g., relaxation or heightened concentration). I'm not sure if that's true, but binaurally modulated noise sounds less monotonous than pure pink noise—kind of like a helicopter circling above a waterfall.\n\nListen to Brainwaver: Pink Noise on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/album/6nUrFEp7Vhz6iEv1e09hnv?si=i34g5tHXQN2WE2TLHwqTsw) or [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/pink-noise/803098796)"

        "description": "When planning a party — whether for friends, colleagues, or clients — I usually take care of the music myself. I enjoy curating playlists and selecting songs that fit the occasion and mood. For me, music is too important to rely on AI-generated or generic playlists. I want the experience to feel intentional and personal.\n\nHowever, I kept running into the same problem: after assembling a playlist of 80-120 songs, I'd notice that similar tracks or songs from the same artist often ended up grouped together. That's natural — it reflects the way we think while adding songs. But it doesn't make for a good listening experience.\n\nShuffle mode in Spotify seemed like a quick fix, but it caused another issue: when the playback is stopped (e.g. during a dinner or speech) and resumed later, Spotify doesn't remember which songs have already been played. As a result, some tracks repeat, while others don't get played at all.\n\nTo avoid this, I wanted a way to shuffle the playlist once and then play it in regular, sequential mode — ensuring all songs are played once, in a good order, without repetition. Doing this manually for large playlists is tedious and time-consuming.\n\nThat's why I wrote a small Python script in a Jupyter Notebook to automate the process. It connects to your Spotify account, takes a playlist, shuffles it once, and saves the shuffled version as a new playlist. This gives you a great base to start from — and you can still reorder a few songs manually if you like.\n\nYou can find it on GitHub:  \n🔗 [github.com/mtln/shuffle_spotify_playlist](https://github.com/mtln/shuffle_spotify_playlist/blob/main/ShuffleSpotifyPlaylist.ipynb)"
