        "description": "My first software that was used productively was called 'Patient'. I wrote it as a teenager in Turbo Pascal for my mother, who, in addition to being a housewife, also worked part-time as a self-employed physiotherapist. The DOS application was multicolored and could be operated with a mouse. We had an Intel 80386 DX 20 MHz computer with a 1 GB hard drive and a simple dot-matrix printer. With my patient management software, one could not only schedule appointments and do the accounting, but also directly fill out the yellow forms that had to be submitted to the disability insurance (IV) for billing. At the time, my mother was probably the only physiotherapist who sent forms to the insurance not handwritten but neatly filled out by a printer ðŸ˜€. \n\n ![Patient menu screenshot](patient1.jpg) \n\nThe completely exaggerated title 'Physikalisch-Therapeutisches Institut Ruth KrÃ¤mer & Co.' was, of course, meant as a family insider joke.  \n\n ![Patient detail screenshot](patient2.jpg)"

        "description": "Music was always my great love. After high school, I went to the Jazz School in Lucerne, but later decided to pursue a degree in computer science at ETH Zurich. Ear training is essential in music, so I programmed 'Ohr', a software for ear training, which allowed users to practice recognizing intervals, chords and their inversions, scales, and so on. To make it possible to practice on the go (laptops didn't exist yet), the software included a feature for creating exercises that could be recorded directly onto cassette. In parallel, the solutions were printed out so that one could practice with a Walkman and a sheet of paper wherever they wanted. The Sound Blaster card was the first to support speech synthesis and could be used with a text-to-speech command-line tool `c:\\sb\\sbtalker\\say.exe`. So, to keep track during practice, every 10 exercises were announced.  \n\n ![Soundblaster](ohr1.jpg)"

        "description": "To access the internet back then, you had to dial in via a modem over the phone line. There was a basic charge for establishing the connection and a per-minute fee with three different time-based pricing levels. Internet costs could quickly become very high, and if you lived in a shared apartment or worked remotely for an employer, you needed to know for each 'internet session' when it happened, how long it lasted, and who would be responsible for paying at the end of the month.\n\nThat's exactly why I wrote Teltax. It was activated each time a modem connection ended, allowing you to specify whose account the costs should be charged to. The details were read from the technical log of the Win95 modem driver (e.g., `c:\\win95\\ModemLog_Zeus 336E External 33600 Fax Modem.txt`). Then, the costs were calculated based on the three different price levels and written into a log file. At the end of the billing period, a total cost per user was calculated. Additionally, the data volume was analyzed, and the cost per megabyte was calculated. Since charges were based on time rather than data volume back then, the goal was, of course, to keep the cost per megabyte as low as possible by truly using the connection and not keeping it open for too long.\n\n ![Teltax summary screenshot](teltax1.jpg)"

I had attached a Wiimote to the guitar head. With quick movements in different directions, I could trigger samples, and with slower movements, I could control parameters of the guitar effects. In addition, I could use the Wiimote buttons to control Ableton Live (start tracks). Thereâ€™s nothing more boring at concerts than guys on stage sitting behind a laptop. As an audience member, you have no idea if what they're doing has anything to do with what you're hearing or if they're just checking their emails or stock prices. Thatâ€™s why I was behind the guitar and not behind a computer.  \n\n For the Guitar Rig Hero Contest by Native Instruments, I demonstrated my setup in a rather silly video ðŸ¤£.\n\n[![Watch WiiMIDIi demo on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8vSY9S_ypdI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSY9S_ypdI)"

        "description": "Back in the mid-90s, while studying at ETH, I always carried a cassette with self-generated pink noise for my Walkman (I used Cool Edit for that). Later, of course, it was an MP3. In 2013, there was an opportunity to release an EP for free on Spotify and other streaming platforms. I used this to publish my pink noise tracks online under the name 'Brainwaver', so there's no need for copying MP3s anymore.  \n\nI listen to the tracks through headphones whenever I want to focus in a noisy environment or just unwind and relax. Pink noise masks external sounds and, unlike music, doesnâ€™t distract. White noise has an evenly distributed intensity across the frequency spectrum (which can sound quite harsh). With pink noise, the intensity decreases as frequency increases; the lower frequencies are louder, while the higher ones are softer, creating a more pleasant soundâ€”similar to a waterfall.\n\nThere's a theory that the binaural modulation of noise, when listened to with headphones, can cause brain waves to synchronize with the modulation frequency, potentially inducing certain mental states (e.g., relaxation or heightened concentration). I'm not sure if that's true, but binaurally modulated noise sounds less monotonous than pure pink noiseâ€”kind of like a helicopter circling above a waterfall.\n\nListen to Brainwaver: Pink Noise on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/album/6nUrFEp7Vhz6iEv1e09hnv?si=i34g5tHXQN2WE2TLHwqTsw) or [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/pink-noise/803098796)"
